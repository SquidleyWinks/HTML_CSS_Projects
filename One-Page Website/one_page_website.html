			<h1>Welcome to PICTURES OF MY CATS!</h1>
			<p>I wasn't sure if this assignment needed to be of a different topic<br>
				from the website project we had already started. SO, I decided to<br>
				throw something together real quick that would meet the minimum requirements<br>
				while demonstrating maximum cuteness! Please enjoy, but do not touch (Even gently<br>
				stroking your monitor screen will disrupt the cats, mostly through smudges,<br>
				so please control yourself.)</p>

					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/This Face.jfif" alt="My Cat Leo">
						<p>This is Leo -- he is obsessed with strings and Fancy Feast.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Paws.jfif" alt="Paw-paw close-up">
						<p>This is a close-up of his little paw-paws. Do not touch them.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Gremlin Squat.jfif" alt="My Cat Squeaks">
						<p>This is Squeaks -- he is as ridiculous as his name implies.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Sweet Baby.jfif" alt="He loves being held like a baby">
						<p>Every morning, he begs to be held like a little baby.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Angry Baby.jfif" alt="Hey, hold me better!">
						<p>Leo also likes being held like a baby, but he doesn't want that fact to damage his tough-guy reputation.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Cuddles.jfif" alt="Cuddling Kitties">
						<p>At night, they sleep on the couch togther, often cuddling for extra warmth.</p>
						<br>
					<img src="./Rumplepuffs/Sun Boys.jfif" alt="This seat is barely big enough for the both of us">
						<p>They will also cuddle in the daylight, but it is less common (and more competative, seat wise).</p>
